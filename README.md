# WeasyPrint HTML to PDF/PNG Microservice

The [docker-weasyprint](https://github.com/BCDevOps/docker-weasyprint) project bundles [Weasyprint](http://weasyprint.org/) into an easy to use, OpenShift compatible, HTML to PDF/PNG microservice with a simple REST interface.

# Images

Pre-built images can be found here; [bcgovimages/weasyprint](https://hub.docker.com/r/bcgovimages/weasyprint)

`docker pull bcgovimages/weasyprint`

# Usage - Docker Example

Run the docker image, exposing port 5001

```
docker run -p 5001:5001 bcgovimages/weasyprint
```

A `POST` to `/pdf` on port 5001 with an html body will result in a response containing a PDF. The filename may be set using a query parameter, e.g.:

```
curl -v -X POST -d @test.html -JLO http://127.0.0.1:5001/pdf?filename=result.pdf
```

This example will use the file `test.html` and return a response with `Content-Type: application/pdf` and `Content-Disposition: inline; filename=result.pdf` headers.  The body of the response will be the PDF rendering of the html document. To generate a png, make a call to `/png` instead

In addition `/health` is a health check endpoint and a `GET` returns 'ok'.
